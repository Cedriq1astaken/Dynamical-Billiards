# *Dynamical Billiards*

A lightweight simulation of dynamical billiards, a classical system where a point particle moves freely inside a domain and reflects elastically off the boundaries deterministic chaos, stability, sensitivity to initial conditions, and geometric effects on trajectories.

## *Features*

- Simulation of multiple point particles moving with constant speed
- Elastic reflections using geometric reflection laws
- Multiple domain types
- 
- Interactive visualization
- Adjustable initial position / velocity
- Stable numerical integrator using analytic intersection
- Rudementary implementation of quantum chaos using a Gaussian Wave Packet
